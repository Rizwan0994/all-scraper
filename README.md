## 🚦 Usage Tips

### For Best Results:
1. **Start small**: Test with 100-500 products first
2. **Use delays**: Don't set DOWNLOAD_DELAY below 1 second
3. **Monitor logs**: Check `logs/scraper.log` for issues
4. **Clean data**: Use built-in deduplication and validation
5. **Batch processing**: Process large datasets in smaller batches

### Rate Limiting:
- Amazon: 1-3 second delays recommended
- eBay: 2-5 second delays recommended  
- Use proxy rotation for large scraping sessions

## 🛡️ Legal and Ethical Considerations

- **Respect robots.txt**: Check site policies before scraping
- **Rate limiting**: Don't overload servers
- **Personal use**: Ensure compliance with site terms of service
- **Data privacy**: Handle scraped data responsibly

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Import errors**: Run `python setup.py install`
2. **No products scraped**: Check internet connection and site availability
3. **Memory issues**: Reduce MAX_PRODUCTS_PER_SITE
4. **Blocked requests**: Enable proxy support or increase delays

### Getting Help:

1. Check logs in `logs/scraper.log`
2. Run `python setup.py test` to verify setup
3. Use `python main.py status` to check configuration

## 📈 Performance

### Benchmarks:
- **Amazon**: ~500-1000 products/hour
- **eBay**: ~300-800 products/hour
- **Memory usage**: ~100-500MB for 10k products
- **Storage**: ~50-200MB per 10k products (without images)
